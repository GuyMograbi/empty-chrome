### empty-chrome

empty-chrome is a way to open a chrome driver version of chrome. This allows us to open a version of chrome that is empty with no extensions or profiles.

The advantage of opening chrome in this manner means when we run devtools like the timeline we won't be bogged down by all of the extensions.
